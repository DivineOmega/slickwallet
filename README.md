Slick Wallet is a new bitcoin wallet, focusing on simplicity and user friendliness. It will be available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

It is powered by bitcoinj, the same libray that runs Multibit and the Bitcoin Wallet for Android. It also uses web technologies for the graphical user interface.
