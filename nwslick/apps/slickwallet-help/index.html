		<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
		<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that lives on the Internet. Unlike traditional currencies, you can store
		bitcoins yourself, without the need for a bank.</p>
		<p>You can send bitcoins to anywhere in the world for a very tiny fee, making it great for shoppers and for
		merchants.</p>
		<p>Slick Wallet allows you to store, send and receive bitcoins yourself, on your PC, laptop or netbook.</p>

		<h2>What is a Bitcoin address?</h2>
		<p>A Bitcoin address is an identifier which allows you to receive bitcoins.</p>
		<p>You can give your Bitcoin address to friends, colleagues and business partners to allow them
		to send you bitcoins.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a name="receiving"></a>
	<div class="help-bordered">
		<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Help menu</a></p>
		<h2>How to receive bitcoins</h2>
		<p>To receive bitcoins in any Bitcoin wallet, you need to give someone your Bitcoin address.
		This will allow them to send you bitcoins.</p>
		<p>In Slick Wallet, go to the 'My Bitcoin Address' tab and you will see your Bitcoin address.
		You can send this to someone, or if they are there with you, you can let them scan the QR 
		code shown underneath it.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a name="sending"></a>
	<div class="help-bordered">
		<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Help menu</a></p>
		<h2>How to send bitcoins</h2>
		<p>Before you can send bitcoins to someone, you need their Bitcoin address. If you don't have this, 
		ask them for it first.</p>
		<p>To send someone bitcoins in Slick Wallet, go to the 'Send bitcoins' tab. You then need to enter:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Bitcoin address you wish to send bitcoins to</li>
			<li>The amount you wish to send</li>
			<li>The password used to protect your wallet</li>
		</ol>
		<p>When this information is filled out, click 'Send' and Slick Wallet will tell you if there were any problems.</p>
		<p>If you have a webcam on your computer or laptop and a QR code of someone's Bitcoin address, you 
		can click the 'Scan QR code' instead of typing it all in.</p>

		<h2>What are Slick Wallet apps?</h2>
		<p>Slick Wallet apps are small, specialised programs that add new features to Slick Wallet.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find out more about bitcoins and wallets</li>
			<li>Spend your bitcoins at various companies/charities</li>
			<li>Buy/sell bitcoins for other currencies</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Slick Wallet ships with with some apps built-in, including this help app.</p>
		<p>For developers wanting to build their own apps, take a look at the code for this help app
			in the 'nwslick/apps/slickwallet-help/' directory.

	<div class="help-bordered">
		<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Help menu</a></p>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>Your Slick Wallet is protected by a long password that you set the first time you start it.</p>
		<p>You'll be asked for this password before you send any bitcoins, which keeps you reasonably secure.
			However, there are more steps you can take to be secure.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not give out your password to anyone you do not trust - Bitcoin transactions are not reversible!</li>
			<li>Avoid computer viruses - If you type your Slick Wallet password into an infected computer, you could risk your bitcoins being stolen.</li>
			<li>Don't put all your eggs in one basket - Consider splitting your bitcoins between multiple wallets with different passwords</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you feel the bitcoins your Slick Wallet may be vulnerable, you should create a new wallet on a seperate, secure computer and send 
		your bitcoins to it as soon as possible.</p>

	<a name="backup"></a>
	<div class="help-bordered">
		<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Help menu</a></p>
		<h2>Backing up your Slick Wallet</h2>
		<p>Technically, the only file you need to backup is the 'slick.wallet' file found in the 'nwslick/jslick/' directory.
			This file contains your password protected 'private keys' that are used to unlock access to your bitcoins.
		</p>
		<p>That being so, we recommend you back up your entire Slick Wallet directory. This will make your backup  into
		a fully working Slick Wallet installation and allow you to recover quickly and easily in case of emergencies.
